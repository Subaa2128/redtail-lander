    question: "What is term life insurance?",

    description: [
      "Term life insurance is the more basic form of life policy, but that shouldn’t be misconstrued as lesser. Term life policies are common and have important features.",
      "Term policies generally provide coverage for a defined term, during which time they’ll pay death benefits if the policyholder passes away in a covered claim. Coverage expires at the end of the defined term (unless the policies are converted to whole life insurance policies).",
      "Because term policies only provide coverage for a defined timeframe, their premiums are stable and affordable. These policies tend to have the lowest premiums available.",
      "This type of policy might make sense if you only need coverage for a certain amount of time. You might purchase a policy that lasts until your children graduate college, or until you and your spouse have sufficient retirement savings. A knowledgeable insurance agent can help you determine whether this indeed is the right life coverage for you.",

  {
    question: "What is whole life insurance?",
    image: ImageTwo,
    description: [
      "Whole life insurance combines death benefits with long-term savings. A portion of premiums is invested into the savings portion of the policy, and this generally grows over years and decadence. The premiums also increase with time, but returns from the savings may cover the full premium later in life.",
      "Whole life policies, of course, are so-named because they’re intended to provide coverage for your entire life. You may choose to maintain lifelong coverage if you want the savings feature, or if you have someone that must be provided for when you’re no longer able to (e.g. a child with disabilities).",

    question: "Are women able to purchase life coverage when they’re pregnant?",
    image: ImageThree,
    description: [
      "Insurance companies regularly underwrite life policies for pregnant mothers. Many women first consider life coverage when they have a child, after all.",
      "When the pregnancy is routine and complication-free, there’s usually little issue finding term and whole life insurance policy options. Policies are still available when complications, such as high cholesterol or diabetes, are at play. Finding coverage in these situations might require more assistance from an experienced Texas insurance agent, though.",

    question:
      "How much coverage should people purchase when getting a life policy?",
    image: ImageFour,
    description: [
      "There’s no one formula that perfectly determines how much life coverage each person should purchase. Calculating coverage needs requires taking into account income financial obligations, investment expectations, life situation, and numerous other factors. ",
      "An insurance agent or financial advisor can provide guidance as to how much coverage might make sense in a particular situation.",
